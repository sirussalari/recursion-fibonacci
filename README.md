# recursion-fibonacci
This is an assignment part of the Odin Project Curriculum.

This is a simple program written in Ruby that is meant to return an array containing Fibonacci numbers. The size of the array is an argument for the function, which allows for the user to choose how many Fibonacci numbers they want returned.

The first block and the second blocks of code lead to the exact same result, although their approaches are different.

The top block of code is demonstrating iteration. In iteration, a loop such as a "for" or "while" loop. In the context of this function, the amount of loops is defined by the user.

The bottom block of code is demonstrating recursion. In recursion, a function calls itself repeatedly. In the context of this function, the amount of times that the function is called is defined by the user. The function uses an "if" conditional to know when to stop running the program.
